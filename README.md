# PySpark Learning

This repository is dedicated to learning PySpark. It contains Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and scripts to help you get started with PySpark.

## Structure

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning.
- `data/` - Datasets used in the notebooks.
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for various PySpark tasks.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pyspark-learning.git
    cd pyspark-learning
    ```

2. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to begin learning.

### Project Structure

- `notebooks/` - This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning. You will find notebooks covering various PySpark topics and exercises.
- `data/` - This directory is intended for datasets used in the notebooks. Add any datasets you need for your exercises here.
